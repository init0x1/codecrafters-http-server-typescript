# Gzip Compression

## Task Overview
In this stage, you need to implement actual gzip compression for your HTTP responses:
1. Compress the response body using the gzip algorithm
2. Set appropriate headers for compressed content
3. Ensure the compressed content is properly sent to the client

## HTTP Response Requirements
When a client requests gzip compression via the Accept-Encoding header, your server must respond with:
- Status code: `200 OK`
- Content-Type: `text/plain`
- Content-Encoding: `gzip`
- Content-Length: Size of the compressed body
- Body: The gzip-compressed content

## Example
**Request:**
```
GET /echo/abc HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4221
Accept-Encoding: gzip
```

**Expected Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 23

[Binary gzip-compressed data]
```

## Technical Notes
- The gzip compression algorithm may actually increase the size of very small strings
- You can verify your compression is correct using: `echo -n <string> | gzip | hexdump -C`

## Solution Workflow

Here's how I approached solving this task:

1. **Updated the response handler**:
   - Modified `handleEncodedContent` to use Node.js's zlib module for gzip compression
   - Changed the return type to Buffer to properly handle binary data
   - Ensured headers and binary content are properly combined

2. **Implemented binary data handling**:
   - Used `zlib.gzipSync()` to compress the content string
   - Created a Buffer.concat() approach to combine text headers with binary content
   - Set the Content-Length header to the actual size of the compressed data

3. **Updated the router and main server**:
   - Modified the router's return type to accept both string and Buffer responses
   - Updated the main server to handle Buffer responses correctly
   - Ensured the socket.write() method receives the proper data type

4. **Fixed encoding detection**:
   - Improved the `checkAcceptEncodingHeader` function to properly handle comma-separated values
   - Added trimming of whitespace to correctly identify compression schemes

The implementation successfully compresses response content using gzip when requested by the client, while maintaining all previously implemented functionality.
